<br><b>Eugene Rabinovich ('11)</b>


<p> 


Eugene Rabinovich is the top of his class at Solon High School, and his experience with rigorous curricula 
and standardized testing is thorough. He has taken and received a 5 on 11 AP tests: Biology, Chemistry, Physics B,
 Computer Science AB, Calculus BC, French Language (which he took as a sophomore after his teachers recommended that 
he skip two levels of the language at his school), Latin: Vergil (largely self-taught), U.S. History, European History,
  English Language and Composition, and Music Theory. His SAT II scores are no less exceptional; he has received
 a score of 800 on French, 800 on Physics, 800 on Math II, and 770 on Biology-M, and his SAT I score is 2390.
 Eugene is no foreigner to tutoring: he has been tutoring regularly since the summer of 2008, and he loves helping 
others out, especially with French and physics. Eugene is also experienced with competition testing: he has received 
national recognitions for various Olympiads, including medals at the Science Olympiad National Tournament, 
placement in the High Honors category (top 50) on the United States National Chemistry Olympiad, and 
membership of the US Physics Team (a group composed of the top 20 physics students in the country). 
Eugene absolutely loves learning, and much of his free time is spent brushing up on physics; 
when he's not studying physics, Eugene enjoys taking walks and going for bike rides in cool September weather.  </p>
