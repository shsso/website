<p>Despite facing the drudges of antagonistic weather, we managed to draw from our courage and bravery of heart and raise $70 during today's car wash. The forces of nature put up an admirable stance; at some points, persistent drizzle and ominous, darkly-shrouded clouds threatened to dispel our spirits. However, that could not stop Solon Science Olympiad's determination. With sponges and hoses in hand, we prevailed. We shall carry this attitude throughout the season.</p>
<h2 align="center">- July 22, 2010 -</h2>
<p>Thank you for all of your efforts at our last car wash - we raised about $160! Our second car wash is this Sunday, July 25, 11 am - 3 pm at the same location. Also, we have moved our Scavenger Hunt to Saturday, August 21, from around 5-10 pm. More details will be available later.</p>
