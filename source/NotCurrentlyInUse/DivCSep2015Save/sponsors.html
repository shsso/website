<h1>Sponsors</h1>

<p>Here at Solon Science Olympiad, we would greatly appreciate support from our local businesses and community.  As we consistently place in the top 5 teams at the National Tournament and having recently won the National Championship in 2013 in both divisions (B and C), we are highly visible and the most well-known team in Science Olympiad.  Part of our success is derived from attending many invitationals in the winter and spring.  We use sponsorship money towards paying for resources such as textbooks and mechanical parts for our devices, registration fees, and transportation and housing costs. Sponsorships are annual. If you or your corporation is interested in sponsoring us for the 2015-2016 year, please email:</p>

<h3>How will sponsors be recognized?</h3>
<p>Depending on the level of sponsorship and time of sponsorship agreement, our team will be able to recognize sponsors in different ways:
<ul>
<li>Competition t-shirt logo placement: If sponsorship occurs before October, the sponsor's logo will be placed on our competition t-shirts.  These shirts are worn to every invitational which take place almost every weekend January through early March around Ohio and sometimes bordering states.  On average, each invitational is attended by around 50 teams (including the B division) which translates to roughly 750 students and 100+ parents/coaches/volunteers. They will also be worn at the State Tournament (80 teams, 1200 students, 200+ adults), and if we advance to Nationals (120 teams, 1800 students, 400+ adults), for part of our trip there.  The shirts are also worn to any restaurants or malls that we may stop at during our trips.  The size of the logo will vary according to the level of sponsorship.</li>
<li>Additional (not official competition shirts) t-shirt logo placement: If we advance to Nationals, we will also design new shirts to wear for part of the trip there.  There may be other instances in which we design new shirts depending on how well we do at Nationals as well.  If we do not advance to Nationals, sponsors are still guaranteed the next one or two additional shirts regardless if they renew their sponsorships.</li>
<li>Logo placement on front page of website: The sponsor's logo will be displayed at the bottom of our home page on our website (http://solonscienceolympiad.org/DivCNew/index.html).  The level of sponsorship will be indicated.</li>
<li>Logo placement and recognition on this page: The sponsor's logo will be placed on this page of the website.  The level of sponsorship will be indicated.</li>
<li>Logo placement on a banner at the Solon Invitational: The Solon High School Invitational is attended by around 50 teams every year (750 students, 100+ coaches).  The banner will be displayed prominently by the entrance.  The level of sponsorship will be indicated.</li>
<li>Logo placement on slideshow at the Solon Invitational: Sponsors' logos will be included in the slideshow of pictures and video of the day's events that is shown before the Awards Ceremony.</li>
<li>Logo placement on event signs: Sponsors' logos will be placed on the event signs marking the name of the event outside each competition room.</li>
<li>Solon Invitational Sponsorships: See below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solon Invitational Sponsors</h2>
<p><b>Food/drink sponsorships:</b> Grocery stores or food vendors may choose to provide food/drink for our concession stand at the Solon Invitational.  We are always looking for pizza, hot dogs, and individually canned soft drinks.  The sponsors' names will be displayed prominently next to the concession stand and will be included in the Solon Invitational slideshow.  If contributions total over $300+ worth, the sponsors' names will be placed on a banner at the Solon Invitational.</p>
<p><b>Event sponsorships:</b> Sponsors may choose to "sponsor an event" for $50.  The sponsor's name/logo will be placed on the event sign, which will be seen for sure by the 100 students competing as well as any of the 750+ students passing by.  For example, a chemical engineering/production company may choose to sponsor the event "Chemistry Lab."
