<h1>Class of 2010</h1>

<p style="font-size: 90%"><b>George Zhao</b><br>George graduated in 2010. He joined Science Olympiad in 7th grade, beginning as an alternate. George's years on the club revolved around the event Bottle Rockets, which he won 4th and 1st places at Nationals in 8th and 12th grade, respectively, both times with fellow classmate Stan Chan. With an undecided course of future studies, although he may not pursue any fields directly related to his Science Olympiad events, George remarks that the experience of self-learning, the chance to share this opportunity of a lifetime with his teammates, and the invaluable friendships developed are all invaluable for a lifetime. George will continue his studies at Columbia University.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%"><b>Max Kolysh</b><br>Ever since he joined Solon Science Olympiad in 8th grade, Max has been a contributing member of teams that won two State championships and placed 3rd and 2nd at the National tournament. His experiences in the club ranged from building trebuchets to reading topographic maps, from designing Rube Goldberg devices to playing science pictionary. More importantly, Max appreciates the teamwork, camaraderie, and genuine curiosity about the world that the club has instilled in him. Science Olympiad has allowed him to be a competitor, a thinker, and a leader. In the 2010 season, he helped lead the team to a near undefeated season through States and a bronze trophy at Nationals, where he placed in three of his four events. Max will continue his S.O.-inspired education by studying engineering alongside the MIT Class of 2014.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%"><b>Stan Chan</b><br>Stan started Science Olympiad in the 7th grade, and since then, Science Olympiad has been more of a family than a team to him.  It fits, then, that Science Olympiad has greatly affected his life; by placing 1st in the event "Egg-o-naut" at the National Tournament at the University of Ilinois at Urbana-Champaign, Stan won a full-tuition scholarship to the university.  Not surprisingly, Stan's favorite events were aeronautical in nature - Bottle Rockets, Egg-o-naut, Gliders, and Helicopter.  Stan will continue his studies in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
