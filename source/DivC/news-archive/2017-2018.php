<h2>April 28th, 2018 - States</h2>
<p>
Great work everyone! 2nd place with 83 points, 5 event wins and only 4 events outside the top 4. Our job isn't close to done though: Mason beat us in 16 events. During awards, one of their parents said to me, "you guys take nationals for granted. Mason's never gone to nationals. That's why we're so excited." He's right! They've wanted it more than us this entire season. They wanted it more than us at states. Don't let them want it more than us at nationals. We leave in 18 days; there's no more putting off studying, putting off building, or putting off calibrating. Every minute we waste that could have been spent doing those things is another place we slip down the rankings. Mentor, Centerville and every other team that didn't qualify would kill to get the opportunity to compete in Colorado. Let's not squander ours.
</p>
<h2>March 3rd, 2018 - West Liberty-Salem</h2>
<p>
Goal achieved - 114 points! Great win over Centerville and Mentor with 6 event wins and 15 top 3 finishes! Thank you to all the members who competed with us during the past season! The team wouldn't be where it is without each and every one of you. That being said: everyone who is competing at states, these last few results don't matter if we don't show up at our next tournament. Let's keep the Solon train running - continue calibrating, studying, and practicing with your partners and we'll be in great position to take the win at states! Watch out, Mason!
</p>
<h2>February 24th, 2018 - Regionals</h2>
<p>
The Solon train chugs on! 1st and 2nd at Regionals with 13 event wins and 5 sweeps! Keep grinding and let's beat Mentor AND Centerville next week. Congratulations also to Mentor, Beachwood, Chardon and Kenston for moving on to states as well! P.S. Mentor our basketball game isn't over yet.
</p>
<h2>February 17th, 2018 - Mentor</h2>
<p>
Great job everyone! 1st and 2nd place at a competitive invitational, with multiple members absent too! We took 17 medals and 6 event wins, with scores of 134 and 145 points. While this win is great, keep in mind Mentor didn't enter themselves into the final scores. We still have work left to do. Don't let up; let's keep working and set our sights for Regionals!
</p>
<h2>February 10th, 2018 - Sylvania Southview</h2>
<p>
Congratulations to everyone on a long overdue win! We placed first and third against a strong Centerville team, and posted a score of 70, our lowest of the season. Overall, we got 24 top three finishes, with 10 of them being event wins. However, our season isn't over. Next week we head to Mentor, so make sure to keep studying and working hard!
</p>
<h2>February 3rd, 2018 - Solon Invitational!</h2>
<p>
Thank you to all the teams that showed up today! We had a great day of competition, and we hope everyone else did too.

Huge congratulations to 3rd place Northville High School, 2nd place Adlai E. Stevenson High School, and champion Mason High School for an incredible performance!

And of course, thank you to the event supervisors for running the events so smoothly; our coaches for organizing the event and working the entire day to keep it hiccup-free; our parent volunteers for running concessions, working hospitality, and scoring tests; our faculty for letting us use the school and rooms; and our team members, for showing up and competing at the same intensity we always do!

Again, we hope everyone had a great time today, and we hope to see you all again next year!

<h2>October 17th, 2017 - Trial Test Requests</h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/wUdiPXJVxL83R4A82">this link</a> to request a make up trial test. Also, just to check how many of you use the website regularly, email the captains an email with your name and the words "coalescing apple butter" in the header.</p>
<h2>October 16th, 2017 - Some clarifications</h2>
<p>Hi all, Aman here. It's been pretty confusing to try and arrange all the make ups we need, so we'll try to do as many during the week as we can, and also sometime before October ends, we will have trial test make ups during the weekend as well. These will obviously be for written tests only, and be conducted at a place to be determined. Stay tuned for more details, meanwhile Pranav and I will try to arrange as many make ups as we can. Also, make sure to frequenty check the calendar for trial test date updates. Thanks!</p>
<h2>October 9th, 2017 - Trial Test Results</h2>
<p>Hey guys, trial test results can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GyO8xdg9hDwdup1WpMVkcEUZHHgCz2YzydQBjAVk9Sc/edit#gid=0">here</a>! Results will be updated as trial tests go along, so don't be concerned if your result isn't up yet.</p>
<h2>October 8th, 2017 - Trial Test Information</h2>
<p>Hi guys, The link to view trial test sign ups (including mechanicals) is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T7pEpmN-zPFNJW1xQItsvMpOg8z3Lx_2izLJNfY2Jmo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The names in green have already taken the tests. If your name is not green and the test date has passed, it either means you do not want to be in the event or you need to make up the test. Either way, it is your responsibility to email the captains (solonscienceolympiad@gmail.com) and let us know what you want to do. It is not too late to sign up for, or drop, trial tests. Once again, email us and we will add/remove you from the list. Thank you!</p>

<h2>August 24th, 2017 - First Meeting</h2>
<p>Hi, all! Today, we held our first meeting of the season. If you couldn't make it, be sure to check the Important Documents for the team minutes and other forms you may have missed. That being said, we'd like to welcome you to the team, and remember, it's never too early to start preparing for your events!

<h2>June 9th, 2017 - New Season</h2>
<p>Hi all. Since the last season is over, it chronologically makes sense that this season begins. With that being said, I'd like to welcome our new Tech Manager, Justin Prindle! He'll be taking care of the website and other related jobs shortly.</p>
