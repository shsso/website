<p>We are extremely appreciative of our community's support! On June 13th, we will be attending the Solon Board Meeting (which will be featured on the local Solon network) and on June 15th, we will be traveling down to Columbus to meet with our state's legislators. Thank you to The Plain Dealer, The Solon Times, and the Chagrin Solon Sun for featuring us. Our end-of-the-year party will be held at the Community Park on June 8th at 4 PM; we will also be electing new captains for next year.</p>
<h2 align="center"> May 23rd, 2011 -</h2>
<p>Our team captured 1st place at the National Tournament, a feat that hasn't been achieved since 1998. Our Solon Division B team won the National championship for the 4th year in a row! Congratulations to Centerville High School (2nd place) and Magsig Middle School (5th place)! Thank you, thank you, and thank you to everyone who made this dream worth fighting for possible.</p>
<h2 align="center"> May 16th, 2011 -</h2>
<p>We leave for Nationals in two days! We hope to continue with our tradition of excellence and represent Ohio with the utmost glory! Bakaw!</p>
<h2 align="center"> May 2nd, 2011 -</h2>
<p>This past weekend, we placed 2nd in the State, trailing by 16 points from the State champions, qualifying for the National Tournament in Madison, Wisconsin! Congratulations to the Division B team who broke a new State record with only 69 points! We are very grateful and appreciate any alums who have helped us on our way.</p>
<h2 align="center"> January 14, 2011 -</h2>
<p>Our teams captured 1st and 4th place at the Northmont Invitational last weekend! Congratulations to everyone who competed. We look forward to competing at the Kenston Invitational this weekend.</p>
<h2 align="center"> December 20, 2010 -</h2>
<p>Happy winter break! Keep on studying (or begin...) studying for Northmont because it is approaching quickly! Also, make sure you turn in your emergency medical cards + dues/chocolate money + permission slip or you will be barred from stepping onto the bus. Stay tuned for any news about a holiday party!</p>
<h2 align="center"> August 21, 2010 -</h2>
<p>With the pounding rain as obstacles and traffic laws as mere suggestions, our Scavenger Hunt today was a success! Congrats to Team ROOS for winning first place, Team Nick's Fist for second, Team Cute 'n Cuddly for third, and Team Alumni for fourth! Prizes will be awarded later.</p>
<h2 align="center"> August 16, 2010 -</h2>
<p>Congratulations! Through our hard work this summer, we have managed to raise $390 in funding! Thank you to our members for their time and effort and to our surrounding community for your donations! In other news, start getting ready for this season: Trial Tests are approaching quickly and it is imperative to perform well in order to be in consideration for placement on Invitational schedules. First meeting September 16 - be there!</p>
<h2 align="center"> July 25, 2010 -</h2>
<p>Despite facing the drudges of antagonistic weather, we managed to draw from our courage and bravery of heart and raise $70 during today's car wash. The forces of nature put up an admirable stance; at some points, persistent drizzle and ominous, darkly-shrouded clouds threatened to dispel our spirits. However, that could not stop Solon Science Olympiad's determination. With sponges and hoses in hand, we prevailed. We shall carry this attitude throughout the season.</p>
<h2 align="center"> July 22, 2010 -</h2>
<p>Thank you for all of your efforts at our last car wash - we raised about $160! Our second car wash is this Sunday, July 25, 11 am - 3 pm at the same location. Also, we have moved our Scavenger Hunt to Saturday, August 21, from around 5-10 pm. More details will be available later.</p>
<h2 align="center"> June 26, 2010 -</h2>
<p>It's that time again - hooray for Science Olympiad car washes! Please attend (and invite all of your friends - that includes Facebook friends) our first car wash on July 11th, 11 am - 3 pm. As usual, there will be festivities later at Squaw Rock at the Metroparks from 6 to 11 pm. Please bring <strong>$3</strong> to subsidize the cost for food as well as your grade's assigned category of even more food and drinks. Hope to see you there!</p>
<h2 align="center"> May 24, 2010 -</h2>
<p>Solon placed third in the nation at the National Tournament at the University of Illinois this past Saturday. Congratulations to Centerville for defending their title, as well as to the Solon Division B team, which won for the third straight year! Thanks to everyone for a fun and successful season.</p>
