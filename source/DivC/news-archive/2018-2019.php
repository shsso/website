<h2>June 2nd, 2019 - Post-Postseason </h2>
<p>
Hey guys this is Derek, doing my final job as assistant tech manager of this year. On behalf of the team I want to personally thank everyone that got us to where we are today: coaches, chaperones, parents, and teammates. Especially the seniors who will now be moving into the next stages of their lives. You guys have been one of the strongest cores of Solon Science Olympiad for the past 8 years and I know that all of you guys will do great things wherever your paths end up. I think that I speak for all of us in saying that I hope that we can give you guys one last hug before you all move onto greatness - don't forget about us when you've all become famous ;)
<p>
For my fellow juniors and underclassmen, we definitely have some work set out for us in maintaining the momentum of one of the top teams in the nation, but more importantly we must continue to maintain the great relationships that have formed along the way. The torch is now passed down to us, and we need to make sure it continues to shine bright, as it has this weekend. 
<p>
Go Comets!! #2 in the nation. #1 in our hearts.

<h2>March 4th, 2019 - Postseason </h2>
<p>
Hey guys! We wanna take the time to thank everyone for another amazing regular season. We have consistently placed top three during the invitational season, and this could not have been done without each and every one of you. That being said. however, we had to leave behind a large number of you when choosing the States team. But, we are forever grateful for the blood, sweat, and tears you all have put into Science Olympiad, and we hope you will cheer us on going forward. 

Now for those advancing onto the State Tournament, it continues to be apparent that we have a significant gap to close if we want to go on to nationals. This year, Ohio cannot be any more competitive. We have about a month and a half to prepare. It's time to pop off    >:)

<h2>March 3rd, 2019 - End of Regular Season </h2>
<p>
Congratulations everyone with a solid performance in our last invitational of the season! Although there were multiple conflicts with scheduling and with the Speech and Debate team, we had a strong showing to end up placing third. Great job everyone during the entire season. We hope each one of you enjoyed the experience and learned a lot!
</p>
<h2>Feburary 23th, 2019 - Regionals </h2>
<p>
Great job everyone and congrats on making states! We took 1st and 2nd with 11 event wins! Next week we face Centerville and Mason once again. Lets kindly obliterate them and make a statement at our last invitational of the season. Also, congratulations to Mentor, Mayfield, Beachwood, and Chardon for moving on to states as well!
</p>
<h2>Feburary 18th, 2019 - Cornell Invitational </h2>
<p>
What a weekend it has been! Hope everyone has had a relaxing two days off after an intense invitational. We placed 2nd overall facing top teams from multiple states. It was an immense effort from everyone and it paid off. Keep in mind, however, that our bigger competitors weren't there. If we want to make it out of states, we must put in twice the effort we are all putting in now. Nevertheless, you all know what you need to do :-) 
</p>
<h2>Feburary 9th, 2019 - Sylvania-Southview </h2>
<p>
Congratulations team for another win! We placed 1st and 8th against a strong Centerville team and a new challenger Pioneer team. Overall, we had 8 event wins and scored under 100 points. But, our season isn't over yet. Next week we go to Cornell University, and we'll be once again facing top tiered teams. Make sure you keep on studying and working hard! 
</p>
<h2>Feburary 2nd, 2019 - Solon Invitational! </h2>
<p>
Thank you to all the teams that came today! Six total states were represented, and we had a total of 70 teams competing. Huge congratulations to 3rd place Adlai E. Stevenson High School, 2nd place Mason High School, and champion New Trier High School. And of course, thank you so much to the event supervisors for running the events so smoothly, our coaches for organizing the event and working so hard to make this the biggest invitational ever; our parent and student volunteers for working hospitality, running concessions, helping event supervisors, and grading tests; our faculty members for not only letting us use our schoolâ€™s rooms but also working tirelessly to make sure our school is clean and organized; and finally our team members for showing up and competing again at such a high level. We hope everyone had a great time, and we hope to see you all again next year! 
</p>
<h2>January 28th, 2019 - What a Start! </h2>
<p>
Hey all, David here! Its been really confusing for me to learn the format of the website but I think I finally got it! Anyways, I think we have a really great start to our 2019 season. 6th/8th at Northview, 1st/2nd at Northmont, 1st/4th at Centerville, and now 3rd/4th at Westlake. While these scores are great, however, keep in mind that we still have so much work to do. Mason and Centerville are our greatest competition right now. They are putting their best effort in every single event, and we have to do so too. Keep grinding, don't give in, and lets put up another great performance at our very own invitational this coming weekend.
