<p>Congratulations to Roger Zou and Yuxi Liu, our new captains for the 2011-2012 Season! <br /><br /> What new wonders, undreamt of in our past, will become wrought in another season? and another? How far will our great team have wandered by the end of next year? And the next decade? Our extraordinary alumni, arrayed on many nations and beyond, will be unified by their common heritage, by their laggard for their second home in humble Room 240, and by the knowledge that whatever Science Olympiad may be, the only SOLON Science Olympians in all the universe, come from here.<br /><br /> Infinite thanks to our captains, Eugene Rabinovich and Stephanie Sang, and the rest of the graduating seniors for helping to make last season the most memorable and successful yet!<br /><br /> We will be recognized June 13th by the Solon Board of Education, and June 15th by the Ohio House of Representatives in Columbus for our tremendous success last season.</p>
