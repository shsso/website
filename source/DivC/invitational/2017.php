<h2>Trial Events</h2>

<p>We will be running two trial events at the Solon Invitational - Geek Speak (Trial Event #1) and Pentathlon (Trial Event #2). If you already signed up for these online, please try to come during your scheduled time slot; if not, these events will be freely Walk-In to allow as many competitors as possible to participate. For trials events, there will be no strict rules against mixing of members between teams from a single school - obviously those rules will still apply to non-trial events.</p>

<h2>Helicopters Room Dimensions</h2>
<p>To all students from any schools that want to know what the helicopters room looks like, pictures can be found <a href="/images/SHSOrchestraRoom1.jpg">here</a>, <a href="/images/SHSOrchestraRoom2.jpg">here</a>, and <a href="/images/SHSOrchestraRoom3.jpg">here</a>. The room is 14 feet high.</p>

		
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Solon High School will, once again, host a Division C Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament. <b style="font-weight:900">Registration deadline is
December 2nd, 2016</b>, and will be done on a <b>first-come, first-serve</b> basis. Please get your registration in ASAP, as this
tournament typically reaches capacity (of <b>45 teams</b>) more than a month before the registration deadline. If the Tournament
reaches capacity prior to the deadline, you will be notified that you are on the waiting list to enter the tournament.</p>

<p>Registration fees will pay for awards, trophies for the top 3 teams, medals for the top 3 places in individual events, and
ribbons for 4th-8th places in each individual event will be awarded.</p>

<p>Due to the difficulty in scheduling this tournament, <b>it is imperative for each participating school to provide all materials
for and run a minimum of one event.</b> Please indicate your first 5 event preferences on the registration form. Again,
scheduling will be done on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>

<p>Doughnuts, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, pop, lunch, and snacks will be for sale at the school.</p>
