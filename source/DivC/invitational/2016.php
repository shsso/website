		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>Solon High School will, once again, host a Division C Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament. <b style="font-weight:900">Registration deadline is
		December 4th, 2015</b>, and will be done on a <b>first-come, first-serve</b> basis. Please get your registration in ASAP, as this
		tournament typically reaches capacity (of <b>45 teams</b>) more than a month before the registration deadline. If the Tournament
		reaches capacity prior to the deadline, you will be notified that you are on the waiting list to enter the tournament.</p>
		
		<p>Registration fees will pay for awards, trophies for the top 3 teams, medals for the top 3 places in individual events, and
		ribbons for 4th-8th places in each individual event will be awarded.</p>
		
		<p>Due to the difficulty in scheduling this tournament, <b>it is imperative for each participating school to provide all materials
		for and run a minimum of one event.</b> Please indicate your first 3 event preferences on the registration form. Again,
		scheduling will be done on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>
		
		<p>Doughnuts, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, pop, lunch, and snacks will be for sale at the school. Since this is designed as a
		fundraiser, we ask that you please not bring outside food into the building.</p>
		<br>
